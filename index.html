<p>Hi! I'm Jan Hudes, a 2nd-year Computer Science student. I'm still figuring things out, but I enjoy learning and exploring new ideas — even when I don’t fully understand them yet.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m curious about how tech works and how I can use it to build cool and useful things.</p>

           <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
<p>I've worked with HTML and CSS before and feel comfortable using them to build and style websites. I’ve joined coding activities and team projects that helped me improve those skills. I’m still new to JavaScript, but I’m learning how to use it to make my sites more interactive.</p>
<p>Since entering college, I’ve also gained knowledge in other programming languages like C++, C#, and Java. These have helped me understand more about how software works and how different languages are used in real-world projects.</p>
